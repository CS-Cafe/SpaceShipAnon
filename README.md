# SpaceShipAnon
A retro space ship game from over a year ago that needs to be demolished in places and rebuilt. It somehow manages 60fps with mostly-immutable objects (likely poor design on my part). Completely refactorable! Go nuts! \[No seriously! I mostly gave up on this project back in 2020. Tear the whole thing down and I'll help rebuild. :)\]
